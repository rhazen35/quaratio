            QuaRatio is an actuarial middleware service, focused on data management and user experience.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>From model to UX</h3>
        <p>
            Three components are needed to provide the user experience:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>1.) The model, created in a model IDE, exported to XML.</li>
                <li>2.) The calculator, at the moment Excel only.</li>
                <li>3.) The view, generated from the model.</li>
            </ul>
            With the model a "view" can be generated. When all components are validated, tested and accepted
            <br>
            the UX is ready.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            A Project can be created to bind the above components into a configuration.
            <br><br>
            When all components are valid and accepted a project can be set to active.
            <br>
            Active projects can be used by customers or intern staff.
            <br><br>
            <u>Customers:</u>
            <br>
            Can provide data as a service and is presented with the view.
            <br><br>
            <u>Intern staff</u>
            <br>
            Can manage, analyze and exchange the collected data.
